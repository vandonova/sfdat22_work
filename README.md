* Read this excellent article, [Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html), and be prepared to discuss it in class on Wednesday. (You can ignore sections 4.2 and 4.3.) Here are some questions to think about while you read:
    * In the Party Registration example, what are the features? What is the response? Is this a regression or classification problem?
    * In the interactive visualization, try using different values for K across different sets of training data. What value of K do you think is "best"? How do you define "best"?
    * In the visualization, what do the lighter colors versus the darker colors mean? How is the darkness calculated?
    * How does the choice of K affect model bias? How about variance?
    * As you experiment with K and generate new training data, how can you "see" high versus low variance? How can you "see" high versus low bias?
    * Why should we care about variance at all? Shouldn't we just minimize bias and ignore variance?
    * Does a high value for K cause over-fitting or under-fitting?

    
**Resources:**

* For a more in-depth look at machine learning, read section 2.1 (14 pages) of Hastie and Tibshirani's excellent book, [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). (It's a free PDF download!)

**Resources:**

* Here's a great [30-second explanation of overfitting](http://www.quora.com/What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-overfitting/answer/Jessica-Su).
* For more on today's topics, these videos from Hastie and Tibshirani are useful: [overfitting and train/test split](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2ij6eaaSl0) (14 minutes), [cross-validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZAM5OXrktY) (14 minutes). (Note that they use the terminology "validation set" instead of "test set".)
    * Alternatively, read section 5.1 (12 pages) of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), which covers the same content as the videos.
* This video from Caltech's machine learning course presents an [excellent, simple example of the bias-variance tradeoff](http://work.caltech.edu/library/081.html) (15 minutes) that may help you to visualize bias and variance.

* This [introduction to linear regression](http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/regintro.htm) is much more detailed and mathematically thorough, and includes lots of good advice.
* This is a relatively quick post on the [assumptions of linear regression](http://pareonline.net/getvn.asp?n=2&v=8).
* John Rauser's talk on [Statistics Without the Agonizing Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dnw46eC-0o) (12 minutes) gives a great explanation of how the null hypothesis is rejected.
* A major scientific journal recently banned the use of p-values:
    * Scientific American has a nice [summary](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-perturbed-by-loss-of-stat-tools-to-sift-research-fudge-from-fact/) of the ban.
    * This [response](http://www.nature.com/news/statistics-p-values-are-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-1.17412) to the ban in Nature argues that "decisions that are made earlier in data analysis have a much greater impact on results".
    * Andrew Gelman has a readable [paper](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf) in which he argues that "it's easy to find a p < .05 comparison even if nothing is going on, if you look hard enough".
* An article on ["P Hacking"](http://www.dailydot.com/geek/data-manipulation-tool-science-p-hacking/) the idea that you can alter data in order to achieve good p values

### Class 14: Decision Trees / Ensembling
* Decision trees ([notebook](notebooks/14_decision_trees.ipynb))
* Ensembling ([notebook](notebooks/14_ensembling.ipynb))
    * [Major League Baseball player data](data/hitters.csv) from 1986-87
    * [Data dictionary](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ISLR/ISLR.pdf) (page 7)


**Decision Tree Resources:**

* scikit-learn's documentation on [decision trees](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) includes a nice overview of trees as well as tips for proper usage.
* For a more thorough introduction to decision trees, read section 4.3 (23 pages) of [Introduction to Data Mining](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook/index.php). (Chapter 4 is available as a free download.)
* If you want to go deep into the different decision tree algorithms, this slide deck contains [A Brief History of Classification and Regression Trees](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-BKohKl-jUYQ3RpMEF0OGRUU3RHVGpHY203NFd3Z19Nc1ZF/view).
* [The Science of Singing Along](http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas03dm/papers/PawleyMullensiefen_Singalong_2012.pdf) contains a neat regression tree (page 136) for predicting the percentage of an audience at a music venue that will sing along to a pop song.
* Decision trees are common in the medical field for differential diagnosis, such as this classification tree for [identifying psychosis](http://www.psychcongress.com/sites/naccme.com/files/images/pcn/saundras/psychosis_decision_tree.pdf).

**Ensembling Resources:**

* scikit-learn's documentation on [ensemble methods](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html) covers both "averaging methods" (such as bagging and Random Forests) as well as "boosting methods" (such as AdaBoost and Gradient Tree Boosting).
* MLWave's [Kaggle Ensembling Guide](http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/) is very thorough and shows the many different ways that ensembling can take place.
* Browse the excellent [solution paper](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChenglongChen/Kaggle_CrowdFlower/master/Doc/Kaggle_CrowdFlower_ChenglongChen.pdf) from the winner of Kaggle's [CrowdFlower competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/crowdflower-search-relevance) for an example of the work and insight required to win a Kaggle competition.
* [Interpretable vs Powerful Predictive Models: Why We Need Them Both](https://medium.com/@chris_bour/interpretable-vs-powerful-predictive-models-why-we-need-them-both-990340074979) is a short post on how the tactics useful in a Kaggle competition are not always useful in the real world.
* [Not Even the People Who Write Algorithms Really Know How They Work](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/not-even-the-people-who-write-algorithms-really-know-how-they-work/406099/) argues that the decreased interpretability of state-of-the-art machine learning models has a negative impact on society.
* For an intuitive explanation of Random Forests, read Edwin Chen's answer to [How do random forests work in layman's terms?](http://www.quora.com/Random-Forests/How-do-random-forests-work-in-laymans-terms/answer/Edwin-Chen-1)
* [Large Scale Decision Forests: Lessons Learned](http://blog.siftscience.com/blog/2015/large-scale-decision-forests-lessons-learned) is an excellent post from Sift Science about their custom implementation of Random Forests.
* [Unboxing the Random Forest Classifier](http://nerds.airbnb.com/unboxing-the-random-forest-classifier/) describes a way to interpret the inner workings of Random Forests beyond just feature importances.
* [Understanding Random Forests: From Theory to Practice](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.7502v3.pdf) is an in-depth academic analysis of Random Forests, including details of its implementation in scikit-learn.
