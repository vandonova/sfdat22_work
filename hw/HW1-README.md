# HW 1 - Intro to Pandas

This homework is designed to assess your familiarity with the pandas data exploration module along with its many features including the split-apply-combine paradigm, graphing, and data manipulation. 

It is designed to be similar to an in-class lab. 
##Steps to complete the homework

* There is a new HW folder in the [repository](https://github.com/sinanuozdemir/sfdat22/tree/master/hw/data).

	* You may place it in the root or in another subdirectory. Your choice. As long as we can easily find it.
* Complete the homework by writing in the code where directed.
	* The questions are very similar to lab questions
* Once complete, please remeber to *push* all commits to Guthub (or else the graders can't see it!) 
	* Refer to the github tutorial for more help in this area
* Submit your homework link via the [google homework form] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pO-lyciINzJGrdjJvJ8voWcMtLL2ZLR3zEBo4e4_Ohk/viewform).




##Stuck?
* Seek help from a peer (collaboration is encouraged!) however every student must submit the homework in full. Please don't just copy and paste from someone else!

* We (the instructors) are more than happy to help you as well but we can't do it for you :) Come find us during office hours or schedule time to meet with us.
